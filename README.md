The following is an Image Processing Pipeline that can detect, highlight and count then number of starfish in a given image. The pipeline uses traditional computer vision techniques that are split up into three categories: Image processing, Image Analysis and Object Detection.

Some notable ones include morphology and watershedding for image analysis and blurring using the mean and median kernels for Image processing. Object detection stage was simple and all that was required was to filter the remaining regions on a set of properties distinct to starfish.
